= Summary

*Checke ARP Cache*:

* Reviewed the ARP cache on the client system (workstation VM) initiating the connection.

* Identified an entry in the ARP cache, confirming ARP functionality.

*Find where the packet gets lost*:

* Executed tcpdump on the compute node's network interface associated with the br-ex bridge.

* Observed incoming ICMP echo requests but noted the absence of reply packets.

* Located the tap interface connected to the instance.

* Performed tcpdump on this tap interface.

* Discovered that ICMP echo requests reaching the external NIC were not reaching the instance's tap interface, indicating an issue inbetween.

*Trace the packet flow*:

* To delve deeper into the issue, captured an ICMP packet in a file and utilized the ovs-appctl command to trace its journey through the network.

* Noted the processing steps within the OpenFlow pipeline.

* Traced the flow to identify the point where packets were being dropped.

*Identified Logical Flow*:

* Discovered a reference to a logical flow responsible for dropping the packet due to inadequate access control rules.

* Further investigation revealed that this lack of access was rooted in security group rules.
