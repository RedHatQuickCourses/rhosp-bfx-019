= Evalution

After making the necessary rule adjustments, test the connectivity by attempting ICMP ping and SSH access to the instance. 

[source, bash]
----
ping -c 1 IP
----

[source, bash]
----
ssh -i /home/student/osp_training/.scenariobfx019/scenario-bfx019-key.pem cirros@IP cat /etc/cirros/version
----

**Replace IP with appropriate string in both the above commands.**

.Sample output
----
[student@workstation ~]$ ping 192.168.51.170 -c 1

Verify that these actions are successful, indicating that the added security group rules are now permitting the desired traffic.


== Evaluation

As the stack user on the workstation vm, use the lab command to grade your work.

[source, bash]
----
cd ~/osp_training/scenarios_repo/
./lab grade bfx019
----

[NOTE]
====
Provide the gocubsgo as a password if prompted by the grade action.
====

== Finish

Run the lab finish command to complete this exercise. This step is important to ensure that resources from current exercises do not impact upcoming exercises.

----
cd ~/osp_training/scenarios_repo/
./lab finish bfx019
----

This concludes the lab exercise.
